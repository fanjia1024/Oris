# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness.
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences.
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, threats, or intimidation.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that is inappropriate in a professional open source setting.

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior and will take fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it privately to the maintainers through GitHub (repository owner/maintainers profile contact). Do not use public issues for sensitive conduct reports.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement guidelines

Maintainers may apply these consequences based on severity and pattern:

1. Correction: private warning and request for behavior change.
2. Warning: formal warning with consequences for repeated behavior.
3. Temporary ban: temporary block from interactions.
4. Permanent ban: removal from community spaces for severe or repeated violations.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
