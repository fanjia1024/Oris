# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are prioritized for the active development line:

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Yes |
| Latest `0.1.x` | Yes |
| Older versions | Best effort |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public GitHub issues.

Use one of the following:

1. Preferred: GitHub Security Advisory (private vulnerability report for this repository).
2. Fallback: contact the repository maintainers privately via GitHub profile contact.

When reporting, include:

- Affected component(s) and version/commit.
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept.
- Impact assessment (confidentiality/integrity/availability).
- Any suggested remediation.

## What to expect

- Initial triage response target: within 5 business days.
- We may ask for additional details to reproduce.
- We coordinate disclosure timing and fix release before public details.

## Disclosure policy

- We follow responsible disclosure.
- After a fix is available, maintainers may publish an advisory and remediation guidance.

## Scope notes

For integrations with third-party providers (LLM APIs, external tools, storage backends), please include provider and configuration details because security behavior may depend on deployment choices.
