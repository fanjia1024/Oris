Source: https://www.notion.so/317e8a70eec580cfb252f8b09a40d21c

Last synced: March 2, 2026

## 1. Objective

Convert the architecture into a production-ready self-evolving kernel.

90-day target:

- deterministic execution
- verified evolution loop
- stable governor control
- replay-driven improvement
- network-ready evolution node

## 2. Development Strategy

```text
Kernel First -> Evolution Second -> Network Last
```

Do not build agents or UI before kernel stability.

## 3. Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 | Week 1 | Kernel Skeleton | Compile-ready core |
| Phase 1 | Week 2-3 | Deterministic Execution | Replay-safe runtime |
| Phase 2 | Week 4-5 | Evolution Solidification | Assets generated |
| Phase 3 | Week 6-7 | Selection and Replay | Self-reuse begins |
| Phase 4 | Week 8-9 | Governor Stability | Safe evolution |
| Phase 5 | Week 10-12 | Network Foundation | Evolution sharing |

## 4. Phase 0 - Kernel Skeleton

Goals:

- establish minimal module boundaries
- define `Executor`, `Validator`, `Solidifier`, `Selector`, `EvolutionStore`

Deliverable:

- kernel compiles
- trait interfaces stable

## 5. Phase 1 - Deterministic Execution

Implement:

- step execution
- retry safety
- interrupt recovery
- trace system recording inputs, mutations, outputs, environment hash
- replay engine v0

Acceptance:

- identical replay output
- deterministic execution hash

## 6. Phase 2 - Evolution Solidification

Implement:

- codex adapter capturing patch diff, logs, validation result
- signal extraction from logs
- solidifier that emits gene, capsule, and evolution event
- append-only evolution store

Acceptance:

- successful executions generate capsules automatically

## 7. Phase 3 - Selection and Replay

Selector factors:

- success rate
- reuse count
- recency
- environment match

Replay order:

```text
Detect Signals
-> Find Capsule
-> Apply Patch
-> Validate
```

Acceptance:

- repeated issue solved without new reasoning
- token usage decreases

## 8. Phase 4 - Governor Stability Layer

Implement:

- mutation rate limit
- blast radius check
- confidence decay
- regression detection
- cooling window

Acceptance:

- harmful strategies auto-revoked
- stable success rate over time

## 9. Phase 5 - Evolution Network Foundation

Implement:

- evolution envelope
- publish API (`POST /evolution/publish`)
- fetch API (`GET /evolution/fetch`)
- quarantine system

Acceptance:

- node imports remote capsule
- local validation required
- replay succeeds from remote knowledge

## 10. Parallel Workstreams

Observability:

- replay success rate
- promotion ratio
- revoke frequency
- mutation velocity

Testing:

- deterministic replay tests
- sandbox safety tests
- governor regression tests

Documentation sync:

- architecture
- evolution
- governor
- network
- economics
- kernel

## 11. Milestones

- Milestone A, Day 30: EvoKernel alive, assets generated
- Milestone B, Day 60: self-reuse, replay replaces reasoning
- Milestone C, Day 90: distributed learning across nodes

## 12. Major Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Non-deterministic execution | strict replay checks |
| Evolution spam | governor limits |
| Strategy monoculture | exploration sampling |
| Network poisoning | quarantine validation |

## 13. Recommended Team Allocation

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Kernel Engineer | execution and replay |
| Evolution Engineer | solidify and selector |
| Safety Engineer | governor |
| Infra Engineer | sandbox and network |

Small teams of 2 to 4 engineers are sufficient.

## 14. Definition of Success

Oris is successful when:

- repeated failures auto-resolve
- reasoning frequency declines
- execution stabilizes
- intelligence accumulates safely

## 15. Post-Roadmap Direction

- evolution economy activation
- multi-org federation
- autonomous improvement pipelines
- enterprise deployment layer
