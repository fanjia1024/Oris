## 1. Vision Statement

Oris aims to redefine how software systems are created, improved, and operated.

Traditional software:

```text
Humans build systems
Systems remain static
Maintenance accumulates cost
```

Oris vision:

```text
Systems learn from execution
Execution produces intelligence
Intelligence improves future systems
```

Ultimate goal:

> Software that continuously improves itself through verified experience.

## 2. Foundational Thesis

The next paradigm shift is not larger models. It is:

```text
Post-Training Intelligence Evolution
```

Improvement occurs via:

- execution history
- validated mutations
- evolutionary selection
- distributed inheritance

## 3. Evolution Stages

Stage 0, Tool Era:

- reasoning-heavy
- non-persistent intelligence
- repeated problem solving

Stage 1, Execution Intelligence (Year 1):

- deterministic execution
- evolution asset creation
- replay reuse
- decreasing reasoning dependency

Stage 2, Organizational Evolution (Year 2):

- shared genes and capsules
- team-wide intelligence inheritance
- automated repair reuse
- cross-project learning

Stage 3, Distributed Intelligence Network (Year 3):

- cross-organization evolution
- reputation-driven intelligence
- evolution economy activation
- autonomous optimization loops

## 4. Strategic Transformation

Oris shifts software development:

- from code to execution
- from engineers to evolution designers
- from projects to living systems

## 5. Long-Term System Model

```text
Intent Layer
v
Specification Layer
v
Evolution Kernel (Oris)
v
Execution Infrastructure
```

Oris occupies the intelligence persistence layer.

## 6. Competitive Positioning

Oris does not compete with:

- LLM providers
- coding assistants
- IDE tooling

It becomes:

```text
Execution Memory Infrastructure
```

Historical analogy:

| Era | Infrastructure |
| --- | --- |
| OS Era | Linux |
| Collaboration Era | Git |
| Cloud Era | Kubernetes |
| Intelligence Era | Oris |

## 7. Ecosystem Vision

Future participants:

- AI coding agents
- enterprise development teams
- autonomous services
- infrastructure operators

All contribute evolution assets. Network intelligence compounds over time.

## 8. Economic Emergence

Verified execution generates:

- trust
- reputation
- reusable capability

Intelligence becomes an accumulating asset.

## 9. Adoption Path

- Phase A: internal kernel adoption
- Phase B: organizational rollout
- Phase C: federation
- Phase D: global evolution mesh

## 10. Success Indicators

Oris succeeds when:

- recurring engineering problems disappear automatically
- reasoning demand decreases continuously
- systems stabilize without manual tuning
- organizations reuse intelligence across products

## 11. Risks and Reality

Major risks:

- uncontrolled evolution
- governance failure
- premature automation
- ecosystem fragmentation

Mitigations:

- governor
- economics
- validation boundaries
- spec governance

## 12. Three-Year Outcome

If successful:

```text
Software that learns faster than humans can redesign it.
```

Development becomes evolutionary rather than iterative.

## 13. Final Perspective

Oris represents a transition:

```text
From programming computers
->
to cultivating evolving computational systems
```

## 14. North Star

> Build systems that improve through experience faster than they degrade through change.
