## Abstract

Current AI-assisted software development is fundamentally stateless: successful
solutions are repeatedly rediscovered rather than accumulated.

Oris proposes an evolution kernel that converts successful execution outcomes
into reusable evolutionary assets. Systems improve through deterministic
execution, validation-bound mutation, and replay-based inheritance rather than
model retraining or manual redesign.

## 1. Introduction

Software engineering has advanced through major infrastructure layers:

| Era | Breakthrough |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware Era | Programmable machines |
| OS Era | Process abstraction |
| Internet Era | Networked computation |
| Cloud Era | Elastic infrastructure |
| AI Era | Learned reasoning |

Despite modern AI coding systems, software still does not learn from its own
execution. Oris proposes a shift from reasoning-driven development to
experience-driven evolution.

## 2. Motivation

LLMs provide reasoning but lack persistent operational memory.

Observed limitations:

- identical bugs recur across projects
- engineering solutions are not inherited
- execution success is not accumulated
- reasoning cost scales linearly with complexity

Existing responses such as larger models, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering
do not solve this directly. Oris introduces:

```text
Verified Execution Memory
```

## 3. Core Hypothesis

> Systems capable of preserving validated execution outcomes will improve faster than systems relying solely on reasoning.

Three principles:

1. Execution produces knowledge.
2. Validation determines truth.
3. Evolution selects reusable intelligence.

## 4. System Overview

```

The kernel transforms execution success into reusable assets.

## 5. Evolution Assets

Capsules:

- verified executable solutions
- deterministic replay
- bounded scope
- validation-backed correctness

Genes:

- abstracted strategies derived from recurring capsules
- examples include retry strategies, concurrency repair, and recovery workflows

## 6. Deterministic Evolution

Requirements:

- reproducible execution
- immutable history
- validation gates
- governed mutation

Evolution proceeds only through verified success.

## 7. Replay-Based Intelligence

Before invoking reasoning:

```text
Signal -> Capsule Match -> Replay
```

Successful replay removes redundant reasoning. Over time:

- reasoning frequency decreases
- execution efficiency increases
- stability improves

## 8. Governance Model

The governor layer enforces:

- mutation rate limits
- blast-radius analysis
- regression detection
- confidence decay

Evolution remains bounded and auditable.

## 9. Specification-Centered Development

```text
PRD -> Spec -> Mutation -> Execution -> Evolution
```

Specifications evolve alongside behavior.

## 10. Distributed Evolution Network

Assets may be exchanged between nodes under:

- local validation authority
- quarantine mechanisms
- trust accumulation
- reputation scoring

This enables collective intelligence growth without centralized control.

## 11. Development Loop Transformation

Traditional loop:

```text
Design -> Implement -> Maintain
```

Oris loop:

```text
Execute -> Validate -> Evolve -> Reuse
```

Development becomes cumulative.

## 12. Comparison to Existing Paradigms

| Paradigm | Limitation |
| --- | --- |
| Model Scaling | expensive |
| Fine-Tuning | static |
| Prompt Engineering | fragile |
| AutoML | domain-bound |
| Oris | execution-evolving |

Oris complements rather than replaces AI models.

## 13. Expected Emergent Properties

Long-term operation yields:

- automatic bug elimination
- architectural convergence
- decreasing maintenance cost
- adaptive optimization

Software begins exhibiting evolutionary stability.

## 14. Risks and Open Questions

Key challenges:

- evolution stagnation
- strategy monoculture
- adversarial mutation
- governance scaling

Future work includes formal fitness modeling and distributed trust mechanisms.

## 15. Implications

If successful:

- intelligence becomes cumulative capital
- engineering effort compounds
- organizations inherit operational knowledge

Software transitions from artifact to organism.

## 16. Conclusion

Oris shifts software from continuously redesigned artifacts toward evolving
computational environments.

> The next frontier of artificial intelligence is not better reasoning, but systems capable of remembering verified success.

## 17. Future Work

- formal evolution theory
- economic incentive modeling
- large-scale evolution networks
- autonomous optimization systems

## 19. Closing Statement

```text
Execution -> Experience -> Evolution
```

Computing began with machines executing instructions. The next phase begins with
systems learning from execution itself.
