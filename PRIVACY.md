# Privacy Notice

This privacy notice describes how the Oris open source project handles information in this repository and project-maintained collaboration channels.

## Scope

This notice covers:

- GitHub repository activity (issues, pull requests, discussions, comments).
- Project documentation and examples in this repository.

This notice does not create a hosted SaaS relationship. Oris is open source software that you run in your own environment.

## Data we may process

When you interact with the project on GitHub, maintainers may process:

- GitHub username, profile metadata, and contribution history.
- Content you submit in issues, pull requests, comments, and discussions.
- Technical details you share for debugging (logs, stack traces, environment data).

## Data we do not intentionally collect

- The Oris library/runtime does not include project-owned telemetry collection by default.
- We do not require personal data beyond what contributors voluntarily submit on GitHub.

## Third-party services

If you use Oris with external providers (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, cloud storage, or other APIs), data handling is governed by your configuration and those providers' policies.

You are responsible for:

- Selecting compliant providers.
- Redacting sensitive content before sharing logs publicly.
- Configuring retention, encryption, and access controls in your deployment.

## Retention

- Public repository content remains visible unless removed.
- Maintainers may retain security and moderation records as needed for project safety.

## Your choices

- Avoid posting secrets or personal data in public issues/PRs.
- Request removal/redaction by contacting maintainers (best effort, subject to platform constraints and legal obligations).

## Security

For vulnerability reporting, use [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and avoid public disclosure until a fix is available.

## Changes to this notice

We may update this notice as the project evolves. Material changes will be committed in this repository.

## Contact

For privacy questions related to this project repository, contact maintainers via GitHub repository contact channels.
