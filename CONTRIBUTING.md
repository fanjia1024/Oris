# Contributing to Oris

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Oris.

## Ways to contribute

- Report bugs and regressions.
- Propose features and design improvements.
- Improve docs, examples, and tests.
- Submit code changes through pull requests.

## Development setup

1. Install Rust stable (`rustup` recommended).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Build once to verify toolchain and dependencies:

```bash
cargo build --all
```

## Development workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused changes.
3. Run formatting, lint, and tests locally.
4. Open a pull request with clear context and validation steps.

## Local checks

Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features
```

For runtime-specific work, also run:

```bash
cargo test -p oris-runtime kernel::driver::tests:: -- --nocapture
cargo test -p oris-runtime --features "sqlite-persistence,execution-server" kernel::runtime::api_handlers::tests:: -- --nocapture
```

## Pull request expectations

- Keep PRs small and scoped to one problem.
- Include tests for behavior changes.
- Update docs/examples when public behavior changes.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- Add migration notes when changing public API shape.

Use the PR template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Issue reporting

Use GitHub issue templates for bugs and feature requests:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`

For security reports, do not open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Code style

- Follow Rust idioms and `rustfmt`.
- Prefer explicit, testable behavior over implicit magic.
- Preserve backward compatibility where possible.
